## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- My workflow felt pretty streamlined. I tried to use the Pomodoro Technique to block out times for working on specific tasks. Most of this week was finishing pre-work, so this helped me to stay on task and not jump around. It was also nice to have the time-blocks where I needed to step away for a set amount of time. This helped me to get my brain some rest and allowed me to think deeply about problems throughout the day and not get burned out.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- I thought it was a cool exercise. It took a little work to remember to log my times, but in the end I did find it useful. Typically, I will hand write a list of items to do in a day, but not assign it any time constraints. When using the Pomodoro Technique and setting chunks of time for specific tasks, I found that I was just able to move through tasks a little quicker because subconsciously I was "on the clock". I guess setting some sort of parameter on myself forced me to keep moving along and not get sucked into wasting time.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- An object is a standalone entity that holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods. Objects hold data, similar to an Array, but you can access the values differently. In an array, the values can only be accessed by calling on the index number of a value. With an object, you can use strings.  

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array: If the only info we need is the student and nothing else, an Array is a simpler method.
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object: Since we want to store more data about the states, an object is best because we can assign a value to the capital.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Array: all we want is a list of things with no other data.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array: Again, we only want to list the accounts and not have any other data associated with it.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object: Since we will be tying data to each student (their name, and their cohort).
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object: We want data tied to each ingredient. Simpler and more efficient code would call for a new Object Instance for each ingredient. We can change their values later with an Object as well.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - Array: Because it is just a simple list with no data besides the name.
  - An object would allow for adding some data info besides just the name like "type", "price", etc.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

- When using `Credit Karma`, they might be storing the info being displayed to me in an object. For example, my score itself might be a value displayed with a key of `currentScore`, and a credit card offer I am elidgeable for might be the value/variable displayed with a key of 'newCardOffer'.

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

- This topic was a doozy. I see how deep it can go though and I'm really excited to learn more about it!
- I'm really looking to learn more about the flow of data and learning more about the practical uses of classes and objects.
- It's not so much a question, but I know that I need to keep practicing my syntax and writing and working with Objects and Classes.
