## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- I feel pretty confident asking questions. I have always found myself thinking of lots of questions as I am going through new material and information. I am currently trying to work on getting better at logging those questions somewhere in order for me to go back and answer them or keep in mind as I am learning. I tend to think of questions pretty rapidly, but I keep them to myself until I feel I have exhausted my options for finding the answer. Although, sometimes when I am frustrated I will ask questions I could easily find the answers to without searching, but this only seems to come in times of heavy stress, which isn't very often (thankfully).

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

- It was a little uncomfortable at first! But, it is something I have lots of experience with from learning to produce beats on a computer. I have spent literal years sifting through videos, message boards, and books/pdf's to find answers to questions I wasn't even sure I was asking right. I think it actually really helps me to learn because I usually end up picking up a few extra pieces of info along the way of my initial search. I like how there was usually a few good pieces of baseline information to go off of to put the pieces together.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

- A conditional statement is one that tells a program to execute different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

- An example of a daily life conditional is "If it is Monday - Friday, wake up at 7am. Otherwise if it's Saturday or Sunday, wake up by 9am."

- Conditionals may be used in a web application in a `Password` checking code block. Something like `If the password is entered correctly, then allow onto the next page. Otherwise, print "Invalid Password"`.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.

- You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by following it up with `else if` statements in the code block. What this means is that the program will read the first condition, an `if` statement. If the condition is false it will go down and read the next statement which would be an `else if`. If this statement is true, the program will execute the command from meeting that condition. If false, it will continue down the code block evaluating if the conditions are met for the following `else if` statements or finish at an `else` statement which basically says, if none of the prior conditions are met, then just do this.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

- you can use some of the comparison operators such as `&&` which will check if two conditions are both true  or `||` which will check to see if one or the other is true.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

- Do `if` statements and `functions` only execute based off of binary input?
